# sha256
In this file I'm trying to perform a hack project using the Rainbow method. I have a csv file containing people's names and their hashed passwords using sha 256, I have to retrieve the original passwords which are four-digit numbers (1000-9999). This is the csv file:

### sha256() is a hash func.These function are have excellent uses in protecting sensitive information such as passwords, personal identifiers such as identification items.
## Using Python hashlib to Implement SHA256
Python has a built-in library, hashlib, that is designed to provide a common interface to different secure hashing algorithms. The module provides constructor methods for each type of hash. For example, the .sha256() constructor is used to create a SHA256 hash.
## encode 
encode() which is used to convert a string to bytes, meaning that the string can be passed into the sha256 function
## hexdigest
hexdigest() which is used to convert our data into hexadecimal format
